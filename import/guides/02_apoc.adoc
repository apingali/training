== APOC: Awesome Procedures on Cypher

If you haven't already, make sure to download the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures[latest release of APOC^], place it in your `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` folder and restart Neo4j.

Once you've done that run the following query to check it's correctly installed:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL dbms.procedures()
YIELD name WHERE name STARTS WITH "apoc"
RETURN count(*)
----

Ok, cool!
Now we're ready to start using APOC.

_Note_

The https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/[APOC User Guide^] will be helpful for this section so keep that open in one of your browser tabs.

== Cleaning the database

We're going to practice importing lots of different types of data and cleaning the database after each one.

We can run the following query to delete everything we've imported so far:

[source,cypher]
----
// Delete all the things
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
  'match (n) return n',
  'detach delete n',
  { batchSize:500 }
)
----

This query uses the `apoc.periodic.iterate` procedure which makes it easy to batch up big queries.
In this case we're deleting all the nodes in the database in batches of 500.

We can save this query in the Neo4j browser by clicking on the star button to the right of the query pane.

== Graph ML

http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/[GraphML^] is an XML based file format for graphs.
It consists of a language core to describe the structural properties of a graph and a flexible extension mechanism to add application-specific data.

The http://sonetlab.fbk.eu/data/social_networks_of_wikipedia/[Social Networks of Wikipedia^] paper uses lots of different datasets in this format.
Let's try and import one of them.

Run the following command:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.import.graphml(
  "http://sonetlab.fbk.eu/data/social_networks_of_wikipedia/vecwiki_social_network_extraction/vecwiki-20091230-manual-coding.graphml",
  { batchSize: 5000, readLabels: true }
)
----

You should get a `ProcedureRegistrationFailed` exception.

== Graph ML

Update `neo4j.conf` to have the following entry:

```
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=apoc.*
```

Now retry the import command:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.import.graphml(
  "http://sonetlab.fbk.eu/data/social_networks_of_wikipedia/vecwiki_social_network_extraction/vecwiki-20091230-manual-coding.graphml",
  { batchSize: 5000, readLabels: true, defaultRelationshipType:'RELATED' }
)
----

Once you've done that you'll need to restart Neo4j.

== Graph ML

This dataset doesn't have any labels on the nodes so let's add some:

[source,cypher]
----
match (n)
WHERE exists(n.username)
SET n:Person
----

We can now write a query to find the shortest path between pairs of nodes:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p1:Person), (p2:Person) WHERE p1 <> p2
MATCH path = shortestpath((p1)-[:RELATED*]-(p2))
WITH path WHERE length(path) > 2
RETURN [person in nodes(path) | person.username] AS path
LIMIT 10
----

== JSON

Next we're going to load a JSON API, but first re-run the 'delete all' query from earlier so that we have a clean slate.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
  'match (n) return n',
  'detach delete n',
  { batchSize:500 }
)
----

StackOverflow has a JSON API which exposes questions, answers, comments, tags, and more.

We can run the following query to import the first 100 questions with the `neo4j` tag:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH "https://api.stackexchange.com/2.2/search?page=1&pagesize=100&order=asc&sort=creation&tagged=neo4j&site=stackoverflow&filter=!5-i6Zw8Y)4W7vpy91PMYsKM-k9yzEsSC1_Uxlf" AS uri
CALL apoc.load.json(uri)
YIELD value AS data
UNWIND data.items as q
MERGE (question:Question {id:q.question_id})
  ON CREATE SET question.title = q.title, question.url = q.share_link, question.created = q.creation_date
SET question.favorites = q.favorite_count, question.updated = q.last_activity_date, question.views = q.view_count,
    question.upVotes = q.up_vote_count, question.downVotes = q.down_vote_count
FOREACH (q_owner IN [o in [q.owner] WHERE o.user_id IS NOT NULL] |
  MERGE (owner:StackOverflowAccount {id:q.owner.user_id}) ON CREATE SET owner.name = q.owner.display_name SET owner:User, owner:StackOverflow
  MERGE (owner)-[:POSTED]->(question)
)
FOREACH (tagName IN q.tags | MERGE (tag:Tag{name:tagName}) SET tag:StackOverflow MERGE (question)-[:TAGGED]->(tag))
FOREACH (a IN q.answers |
   MERGE (answer:Answer {id:a.answer_id})
   SET answer.accepted = a.is_accepted, answer.upVotes = a.up_vote_count, answer.downVotes = a.down_vote_count,
       answer:Content, answer:StackOverflow
   MERGE (question)<-[:ANSWERED]-(answer)
   FOREACH (a_owner IN filter(o IN [a.owner] where o.user_id is not null) |
     MERGE (answerer:User {id:a_owner.user_id})
     ON CREATE SET answerer.name = a_owner.display_name
     SET answerer.reputation = a_owner.reputation, answerer.profileImage = a_owner.profile_image
     MERGE (answer)<-[:POSTED]-(answerer)
   )
)
----

== JSON

We can now run the following query to find the most popular StackOverflow questions:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (tag)<-[:TAGGED]-(question:Question)<--(:Answer)<-[:POSTED]-(user)
RETURN question.title, question.views, COLLECT(DISTINCT tag.name) AS tags
ORDER BY question.views DESC
----

== Exercise: JSON

Try changing the query to load a different tag or a different page from the original search term.

If you're not a fan of StackOverflow try loading data from a different JSON API that you're familiar with.

== Dynamic values

Sometimes we'll want to create dynamically computed node-labels and relationship-types as well as any map of properties.
We can't do this in pure Cypher but the `apoc.create.node` and `apoc.create.relationship` procedures come in handy here.

== Dynamic node-labels

Run the following command to create parameters that we'll use in our query:

[source,cypher]
----
:param batch: [
  { labels: ["Person", "Actor"], props: { name:"Alice", age:32 }},
  { labels: ["Person", "Director"], props: { name:"Bob", age:42 }},
  { labels: ["Person", "Writer"], props: { name:"John", age:37 }}
]
----

Now let's create nodes representing each of the people in the batch:

[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND $batch AS row
call apoc.create.node(row.labels, row.props) YIELD node
RETURN count(*)
----

== Exercise: Dynamic relationship-types

Given the following parameter:

[source,cypher]
----
:param batch: [
  { from: "Alice", to: "Bob", type: "FRIEND" },
  { from: "Bob", to: "John", type: "ENEMY" },
  { from: "Alice", to: "John", type: "FRIEND" }
]
----

Can you write a query that creates the appropriate relationship between each person using the `apoc.create.relationship` procedure?

[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND $batch AS row

// lookup nodes
MATCH (from:Person {...})

// create relationship
----

== Answer: Dynamic relationship-types

[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND $batch AS row
MATCH (from:Person {name: row.from})
MATCH (to:Person {name: row.to})
CALL apoc.create.relationship(from, row.type, {}, to) yield rel
RETURN count(*)
----

== Next step

There are lots of other data integration procedures available in APOC - hopefully you can find one that works for you.

In the next section we'll write our own custom import procedure.
