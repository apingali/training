= Importing data using the Neo4j .NET driver

This is an example showing how to use the Neo4j .NET driver to import data into the graph.

First we need to install the Neo4j driver:

Package manager:

```
Install-Package Neo4j.Driver -Version 4.1.0
```

.NET CLI:

```
dotnet add package Neo4j.Driver --version 4.1.0
```

Once we've done that we can execute `Program.cs` to import data into our graph

```
dotnet run name1 name2
```
