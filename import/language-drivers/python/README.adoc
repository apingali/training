= Importing data using the Neo4j Python driver

This is an example showing how to use the Neo4j Python driver to import data into the graph.

First we need to install the Neo4j driver using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once we've done that we can run `import.py` to import data into our graph

```
python import.py name1 name2
```
